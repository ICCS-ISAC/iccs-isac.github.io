## Learning Objectives

In this module we will:

- Identify the key enabling factors and barriers to the adoption of open source software, related to staffing and organizational structure.

- Discuss the wide variety of job functions, professional profiles and skill sets involved in developing, implementing and maintaining open source software projects in a government organization.

- Explore best practices for building and leading a right-sized technical team.

## Key Points

- **A growing policy and legislative landscape supports the adoption of open source software.** However, current structures, practices, and mentalities within many government and public sector agencies can create barriers when it comes to open source software adoption.

- **Technical staffing is one of the greatest perceived barriers to open source software adoption.** A lack of in-house capacity and collaborative culture can lead to over-reliance on vendors: Few government organizations have full-time staff (at leadership and implementation levels) with necessary skills and knowledge to procure, build, and/or maintain open source software. As a result, governments typically rely on vendors.[^1] This can cause vendor lock-in, ballooning costs and hidden fees, and loss of control (over functionalities, updates and compliance).[^2]

- **Executives in organizations of all sizes can overcome these challenges by making strategic investments, reducing real and perceived risk, and encouraging a cultural shift in the organization**. This includes:

  - Learning how open source software procurement, development, and maintenance works and supporting internal working groups and champions.

  - Driving an organizational culture that encourages working in the open and continuous user engagement.

  - Engaging with a variety of partners, peer organizations and service providers to complement the internal team.
