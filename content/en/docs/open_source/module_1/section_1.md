## Software in Government: Use Cases

Governments use software for a wide range of administrative, financial, and operational purposes, from public-facing services to procurement management to secure email. These use cases include (but are not limited to):

- Direct service provision to citizens (issuing permits and licenses, civic issue tracking)

- Fee and payment processing (property taxes, fines, etc.)

- Business intelligence (tracking performance of business units, programs, and services)

- Data management (open data portal)

- Human resources management (payroll and benefits administration, talent acquisition)

- Asset management (monitoring equipment and infrastructure throughout its life cycle, modeling risk and cost scenarios)

- Procurement management (issuing tenders, managing vendor relations)

- Communications (content management, agenda and meeting management, emergency alert services)

## How Government Software is Unique

The government context presents unique requirements for software. The process of obtaining and maintaining software – and the design of the software itself – has distinctive features in public sector environments. Government requires software that:

- Is highly reliable

- Is secure enough to store sensitive or personally-identifiable information

- Can be sourced according to government procurement laws

- Can be budgeted for up front, typically years in advance (as with government purchases in general)

- Can be integrated into legacy IT systems and digital environments

- Will comply with regulations and standards specific to a jurisdiction, such as data residency requirements (i.e., hosting data on local servers as opposed to cloud-based storage outside the jurisdiction) or complying with language and accessibility requirements
