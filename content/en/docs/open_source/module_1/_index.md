## Learning Objectives

In this module we will:

- Review the general use cases for software in government and learn how government software is unique.
- Identify the main differences between open source software and proprietary software by exploring the origins and motivations of the open source software movement, as well as the fundamentals of how open source software works today.
- Introduce the fundamentals of obtaining and maintaining open source software, highlight the benefits of using open source software in government, identify the unique challenges associated with it, and introduce strategies for overcoming those challenges – strategies that will be elaborated in greater detail throughout the course.

## Key Points

- Governments and public sector agencies across Canada and worldwide are already using open source software in significant ways. As governments at all levels incorporate software into a wide variety of processes and services to meet their objectives – from efficient public service delivery to social and environmental goals – open source software presents an excellent option for ensuring quality, ongoing control, and resource efficiency.
- Open source software is fundamentally different from conventional proprietary software in several ways: how it is licensed, owned and managed; how it is developed and maintained; and how it is financed and commercialized. Open source software is freely distributed under an open-source license. Many open source software projects are maintained by a global community of users and developers, while others have a smaller contributor base. While the software itself is free, your organization may invest in in-house staff capacity to integrate and maintain software, or contract with a vendor to add specific features or do a custom integration with your existing digital environment.
- Open source software does not have to be built from scratch. Hundreds of full open source software projects and even more small component open source modules offer as many options and functionalities as conventional proprietary software. These open source projects and modules serve as a foundation upon which new open source software can be built.
- Open source software has the potential to bring a variety of unique benefits to government – including customizability, interoperability, and transparency. While there are barriers to adopting open source software in government – including a lack of in-house technical capacity and inflexible procurement practices – fortunately, there are a variety of strategies and best practices that can help you to overcome these barriers.
