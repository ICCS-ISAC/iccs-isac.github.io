## The Unique Benefits of Open Source Software in Government

There are nine factors that make open source software ideal for use in a government context:

1. **Openness and transparency**. Open source software is just that: open. It isn’t a black box. Global and local communities are able to audit the code, evaluate the implications of its design, and hold each other accountable.

2. **Increased interoperability**. Open source software tends to be built from open source modules. That means any given piece of open source software is likely to use the same sub-modules (or compatible sub-modules) as another. With proprietary software, there is a financial incentive for vendors to create dependencies with their own or their partners’ proprietary software. With open source software, there is an incentive for interoperability because it increases efficiency and replication.

3. **Decentralized, community-led product support**. Open source software relies on different mechanisms for updating and maintaining software, finding bugs and fixing them, but is ultimately just as secure as proprietary software. Because the code is open, security auditors and contributors can inspect the code for security risks or flaws. Open source software projects supported by active communities receive constant updates, which ensures performance and cybersecurity in changing conditions.

4. **Controlled costs**. Open source software itself is free, and you have direct control over all associated costs – whether you hire in-house staff or contract with external service providers. There are no hidden fees, expensive maintenance, paid features, or contract renegotiations.

5. **Strengthened local tech economy**. Local software contractors are well suited to build custom features or integrations for government organizations, because they develop long-term relationships and understand local priorities. In contrast, proprietary software is generally created and commercialized by monolithic software vendors that do not have any connection to local context. By hiring local firms, governments can strengthen the local economy, particularly its tech sector.

6. **Freedom from vendor lock-in**. Proprietary software can be operationally or contractually entrenched in an organization, putting the government at a disadvantage when making decisions in the future. Proprietary software vendors have an incentive to create dependencies, which makes it challenging to freely and fairly choose the best solution. Open source software creates open markets for providers of all kinds of support.

7. **Adaptable to changing requirements**. Policy and regulation changes constantly (for example, accessibility standards, or protocols for personally identifiable information). Proprietary software vendors may or may not release updates to meet changing requirements. Updates are costly and may require renegotiation of contracts. Open source software, on the other hand, can be quickly adapted and shared across jurisdictions.

8. **Customizable to local context and use cases**. While many government organizations perform similar functions, the way in which those functions are carried out may vary from place to place. Governments can address very niche local use cases by developing their own open source software or by banding together with other governments to share a core set of open source software modules and each pay a small fee for a local contractor to create custom features for their unique environment.

9. **Reduced liability**. Government organizations can use open source software however they want (subject to applicable laws and policies), with no additional obligations or restrictions imposed by a vendor. Furthermore, open source software is not subject to the legal risks associated with proprietary solutions, especially those that arise from contracts.

## The Challenges of Using Open Source Software in Government

There are five primary challenges that make it difficult to use open source software in a public sector context. Once they're named, these can be overcome -- and this course will empower you with strategies and tools.

1. **Procurement and budgeting**. Open source software has a very different cost structure. The software itself is free, but there are costs associated with customization and integration. This means a shift from buying a product to building a solution. There is often a lack of funding for developing new software, and resistance to subsequently offering it for free to others. Procurement norms, contract templates and approved vendor lists create barriers to obtaining and using open source software or contracting open source software service providers.

2. **In-house expertise**. The education and training most public sector professionals receive still prioritizes proprietary software, and computer systems often come pre-loaded with proprietary software. For these, and many other reasons, public sector agencies conventionally rely on off-the-shelf software from major vendors, as opposed to hiring and retaining in-house expertise. Staff are often traditionally trained in using proprietary software so the introduction of new open source solutions may require retraining.

3. **Supplier availability**. Smaller municipalities and rural areas may not have a mature local ecosystem of technology companies that are capable of providing services. And while there are several agencies that work across Canada, serving a broad swath of customers, identifying one that can provide services that meet your organization's needs can be a challenge.

4. **Rate of change**. Because open source software is often developed and maintained by a global community, it may have faster or slower rates of updating and change. If updates you need are not emerging from the community, your organization may need to proactively make those changes, or hire a firm that can. When considering open source software, it is important to evaluate the level of activity within the support community and develop a contingency plan in case the open source software is no longer adequately supported and you need to find an alternative.

5. **Governance**. Open source software requires active participation involving contributors and users from different organizations, which can create challenges in managing the responsibility for maintenance.
