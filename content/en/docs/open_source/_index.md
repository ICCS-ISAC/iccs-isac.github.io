Version 1.0

Online version of the learning material prepared by [Open North](https://opennorth.ca/) for the Open Source Software Working Group of the [Institute for Citizen-Centred Service's (ICCS) Joint Councils](https://citizenfirst.ca/our-work/councils).

This version is generated from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ICCS-ISAC/iccs-isac.io) where you can find the source files and contribute to the project.

The material will continue to evolve as we receive feedback and contributions from the open source software community of practice and members of participating public administrations.
