## Learning Objectives

In this module we will:

- Outline the key differences between licensing and development approaches and why government systems are biased toward proprietary software and waterfall development.

- Discuss different software revenue models and how they affect government cost structures.

- Identify new approaches to procurement, contracting, licensing and staffing.

## Key Points

- **Procurement, contracting and budgeting structures and norms are designed for pre-digital assets -- and therefore make it challenging to obtain open source software.** However, as government organizations embrace digital-native approaches, open source software and agile method becomes the easiest path.

- **Open source software requires a different approach to budgeting than proprietary software.** While proprietary software is priced using one of many standard revenue models, open source software is freely distributed, but requires investments in staff capacity and/or service providers to deploy and maintain software.

- **Open source software aligns well with 'agile' methods** -- which also happen to be the best practice for software development. When procuring custom software services, government should use modular contracting and budgeting approaches, which enable Agile development.

- **Procurement is a creative and exploratory process.** Using procurement correctly, you can not only find the best, lowest cost solution, but also generate positive spin-off effects.

- **Pooled purchasing is an effective strategy** for a peer group of government organizations to share the cost of obtaining and maintaining open source software that fills a common need.
