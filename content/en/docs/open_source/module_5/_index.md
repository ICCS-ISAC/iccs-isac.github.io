## Learning Objectives

In this module we will:

- Review the interjurisdictional issues raised in previous modules and key considerations when forming multi-jurisdictional teams around a particular piece of software, including resource-sharing between different jurisdictions or levels of government

- Explore what it means to participate in a global community of codebase stewardship

- Demonstrate the value of releasing your software under an open source license

## Key Points

- **Collaboration on open source software is a win-win.** The software you build, or the adaptations you make, will be useful to other jurisdictions as well. Open source software performs better and becomes more secure as the community around it grows. It is therefore in each user's best interest to contribute, and to add more contributing users.

- **Government organizations do not need to reinvent the wheel.** When source code is released under an open source license, any jurisdiction can make small software adaptations to ensure that the software is best-fit to local use cases, regulations and standards. When a core set of functionalities are shared, each jurisdiction's time, effort and resources can be focused on making small adaptations to fit the software to their local context (rather than building a full set of core functionalities from scratch).

- **Same-level governments are natural collaborators when it comes to designing, obtaining and maintaining open source software.** They are responsible for delivering a similar set of services and have a similar set of needs (internal, administrative and external, resident-facing). They are therefore natural collaborators when it comes to designing, obtaining and maintaining open source software.

- **Jurisdictions already collaborate in various well-established networks and peer groups that can be activated as open source software stewardship communities.** Distributed version control platforms (like GitHub) enable users to contribute or suggest changes in a structured and collaborative way.
