## Open source project maintenance (source code only)

The working group recommends that for open source projects that may be of value to multiple jurisdictions:

- The “Benevolent dictator” governance model be established for the day-to-day source code management.
- An official agreement be put in place amongst the participating jurisdictions at the project level so that:
- The strategic direction and scope of the project be collectively decided at the inception of the project amongst the participating jurisdictions
- The staffing for the project be agreed upon and reviewed yearly
- A multi-jurisdictional team of developers could be set to provide in-kind contributions instead of transferring funds between jurisdictions.
- The ownership of the source code be assigned to the Jurisdiction taking the lead on the project but transfer model be devised in case leadership be transferred.
- The copyright of each contribution remains with the jurisdictions or individuals contributing them (no Contributors Licence Agreements to transfer IP to the Project Lead Jurisdiction
- The it is established that there are no liabilities to the Project Lead Jurisdiction or the participating jurisdictions
Note: This is the same for all OSS licences
- This model could be implement within a few months upon further development and legal review.

## Open source software offered as a service (SaaS-like)

The working group recommends that for open source software operated as service for all participating Jurisdiction (e.g. GC Notify):

- Further research and legal advice be provided for the two following options:
  - A Project Lead Jurisdiction (PLJ) be identified to develop, implement, and operate the open source product as a service for all other participating jurisdictions.
  - ICCS be designated to develop, implement, and operate the open source product as a services for all participating jurisdictions, under a dedicated programme per capability (e.g.: CDS’ GC Notify is available to all jurisdictions, this type of capability could be provided by the ICCS instead).
  - A third option was brought up: ICCS could establishing contracting model out to private sector but pooling of the usage capabilities. There would be one contract in place, all jurisdictions could use as is via ICCS. Sort of broker model.

Logic:
Many scenarios were discussed and studied, including a multi-jurisdiction coordinated service, but the only two that emerged as viable were the ones proposed above.

However, each of these scenarios raise questions:

- How can the jurisdictions support the ongoing costs for maintenance?
  - PLJ: Transfers of funds between jurisdictions is complex and operating a service for other jurisdictions is not currently in any mandates known to the working group members.
  - ICCS: Transfers of funds and project ran by the non-profit organization has been done many times before, but not operating a service for the benefit of the jurisdictions. This raises concerns with regards to competing with the market, trade agreements, procurement legislation (e.g.: sole source, etc.)
- What governance model would be agreeable to all jurisdictions?
  - PLJ: One jurisdiction taking the responsibility to manage a service used by all others requires continuously improving/maintaining the service as long as they all need it.
  What recourse are available to ensure service continuity if the Jurisdiction loses budget/support for operating the service?  
    Will governance be able to effectively enable successor planning as well as sufficient transition timelines?
  - ICCS: Since the responsibility to operate the service would lie with the non-profit organization, what satisfactory governance model can be put in place to ensure fair representation while leaving sufficient autonomy to operate as a true SaaS?
- What Service Level Agreements can be acceptable to all?
  - PLJ: Can a Jurisdiction be held liable for SLA to other jurisdictions?
  - ICCS: Is the non-profit organization designed/conceived in a way that supports this type of responsibility with regards to the Jurisdictions?
- Any scenario: SLAs will need to ensure there are mechanisms in place to prevent “overuse” of a solution where incur costs to other members – accountability of use
- Change management will have certain challenges that governance will need to address
  - Solution Versioning (For especially API lifecyle)
  - Feature Roadmap
  - Maintenance windows
  - Service level agreements
  - Successor
